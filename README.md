# wallet

A custodial crypto wallet with a real path to self-custody: an off-chain
double-entry ledger for instant internal transfers, on-chain settlement for
deposits and withdrawals, an M-of-N multi-sig vault for reserves, and ERC-4337
smart accounts so users can graduate to holding their own funds without the risk
of losing a seed phrase.

Read [PROJECT.md](PROJECT.md) for the problem statement, architecture and full
roadmap.

> **Testnet only.** This is a learning project. It must never hold third-party
> funds, and it is not a licensed custody service.

**Current status: P0 — foundation.** The stack builds, runs and is tested end to
end; the ledger itself starts in P1.

## Requirements

Docker. That is the entire list.

Everything -- Node, npm, Foundry, Postgres -- runs in containers, and every
generated directory (`node_modules`, `contracts/lib`, build output) lives in a
Docker volume rather than on the host.

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env
./wallet install     # install npm + Solidity dependencies into volumes
./wallet up          # start Postgres, anvil and the API
./wallet test        # run both test suites
```

Then:

```bash
curl -s localhost:3000/health/ready | jq
```

`make` works too if you prefer it (`make test`), but it is not required.

## Commands

Run `./wallet help` for the full list. The ones used most:

| Command             | What it does                                          |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `./wallet up`       | Start the whole stack, waiting until it is healthy     |
| `./wallet dev`      | Same, then follow logs                                 |
| `./wallet test`     | Backend tests and Solidity tests                       |
| `./wallet typecheck`| Type-check the workspace                               |
| `./wallet psql`     | psql shell against the dev database                    |
| `./wallet cast ...` | Run `cast` against the local chain                     |
| `./wallet accounts` | Print the deterministic anvil test accounts            |
| `./wallet clean`    | Drop dependency volumes but keep the database          |
| `./wallet nuke`     | Drop every volume, database included                   |

## Layout

```
contracts/          Foundry: vault, smart account, paymaster (P7 onward)
db/migrations/      SQL migrations (P1 onward)
docker/             Dockerfiles for the Node and Foundry toolchains
packages/shared/    Shared config, chain definitions, money helpers
services/api/       REST API
wallet              Task runner -- the entry point for everything
```

## Notes on the setup

**Money is never a float.** Balances are integers in minor units. See
`packages/shared/src/chain.ts`.

**No build step.** Node 26 strips TypeScript types at runtime, so `tsc` is only
a type checker here and there is no bundler or `dist/`. `erasableSyntaxOnly` is
enabled so the compiler rejects syntax that runtime stripping cannot handle
(enums, namespaces, parameter properties) rather than letting it fail in
production.

**Container users are uid 1000.** Both the `node` and `foundry` images run as
uid 1000, matching the host user, so bind-mounted files keep their ownership
instead of turning up root-owned.

**Fixed dependency versions live in the lockfile**, and `solc` is pinned in
`contracts/foundry.toml` so bytecode is reproducible.

## Secrets

`.env` is gitignored and holds local development defaults only. No private key,
mnemonic or API key ever belongs in this repository. The anvil mnemonic in
`docker-compose.yml` is the well-known public Foundry test mnemonic and controls
nothing of value.

Production key material belongs in a KMS or HSM. See the key management section
in [PROJECT.md](PROJECT.md).
